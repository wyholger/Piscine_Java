## Exercise 00 â€“ Tables & Entities

Throughout this week, we will be implementing Chat functionality. In this chat, user can create or choose an existing chatroom. Each chatroom can have several users exchanging messages.

Key domain models which both SQL tables and Java classes must be implemented for are:

- User 
  - User ID
  - Login
  - Password
  - List of created rooms
  - List of chatrooms where a user socializes
- Chatroom
  - Chatroom id
  - Chatroom name
  - Chatroom owner
  - List of messages in a chatroom
- Message
  - Message id
  - Message author
  - Message room
  - Message text
  - Message date/time

Create schema.sql file where you will describe CREATE TABLE operations to create tables for the project. You should also create data.sql file with text data INSERTS (at least five in each table).

It is important to meet the following requirement!

Let's assume that Course entity has a one-to-many relationship with Lesson entity. Their object-oriented relation should then look as follows:

```
class Course {
   private Long id;
   private List<Lesson> lessons;// there are numerous lessons in the course
   ...
}
class Lesson {
   private Long id;
   private Course course; // the lesson contains a course it is linked to
   ...
}
```

Additional requirements:

- To implement relational links, use one-to-many and many-to-many link types.
- Identifiers should be numeric.
- Identifiers shall be generated by DBMS.
- equals(), hashCode() and toString() shall be redefined correctly inside Java classes.
