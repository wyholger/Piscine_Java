Exercise 01 – Really Prime Number

According to Böhm-Jacopini theorem, any algorithm can be written using three statements: sequence, selection, and iteration.

Using these statements in Java, you need to determine if the input number is a prime. A prime is a number which has no dividers other than the number itself and 1.

The program accepts the number entered from the keyboard as input and displays the result of checking whether that number is a prime. In addition, the program shall output the number of steps (iterations) required to perform the check. In this task, an iteration is a single comparison operation.

For negative numbers, 0 and 1, display theIllegalArgument message and shut down the program with the -1 code.

Example of program operation:

```
$ java Program
-> 169
false 12

$ java Program
-> 113
true 10

$ java Program
-> 42
false 1

$ java Program
-> -100
