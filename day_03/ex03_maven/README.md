## Exercise 03 â€“ Too Many Threads...

Let's assume that we need to download a list of files from a network. Some files are downloaded faster, while others are slower.

To implement this functionality, we can obviously use multithreaded downloading where each thread loads a specific file. But what should we do if there are too many files? A large number of threads cannot be run at the same time. Therefore, many of them will be waiting.

In addition, we should bear in mind that continuously creating and completing threads is a very costly operation we should avoid. It makes more sense to start N threads at once and, when either of them finishes downloading the file, it can take on the next file in the queue.

We need to create files_urls.txt file (file name shall be explicitly specified in program code) where you specify a list of URLs of files to be downloaded, for instance:

```

Example of the program operation:

```
$ java Program.java --threadsCount=3
Thread-1 start download file number 1
Thread-2 start download file number 2
Thread-1 finish download file number 1
Thread-1 start download file number 3
Thread-3 start download file number 4
Thread-1 finish download file number 3
Thread-2 finish download file number 2
Thread-1 start download file number 5
Thread-3 finish download file number 4
Thread-1 finish download file number 5
```

#### Notes:

- Output created by the implemented program may differ from the illustration.
- Each file is downloaded only once by a single thread.
- The program may contain an "infinite loop" without the exit condition (in this case, the program can be shut down by interrupting the process).
