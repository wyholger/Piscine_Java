##Exercise 01 – ID Generator
Make sure that each user ID is unique. To do so, create UserIdsGenerator class. Behavior of the object of this class defines the functionality for generating user IDs.

State-of-the-art database management systems support autoincrement principle where each new ID is the value of the previously generated ID +1. So, UserIdsGenerator class contains the last generated ID as its state. UserIdsGenerator behavior is defined by int generateId() method that returns a newly generated ID each time it is called.

An example of use of such classes shall be contained in Program file (creation, initialization, printing object content on a console).

Notes:

Make sure only one UserIdsGenerator object exists (see the Singleton pattern). It is required because existence of several objects of this class cannot guarantee that all user identifiers are unique.

User identifier must be read-only since it is initialized only once (when the object is created) and cannot be modified later during the program execution.

Temporary logic for identifier initialization should be added to User class constructor:
```
public User(...) {
this.id = UserIdsGenerator.getInstance().generateId();
}
```
